# Example: Studying the credit card data set as possible project
We include this data set as an example on how one could study new data sets with the algorithms we have discussed during the lectures, using either your own codes or the functionality of scikit-learn, tensorflow or other Python packages.

The data set is presented at the site of UCI. It is particularly interesting since it is also analyzed using ML methods in a recent scientific article.

The authors apply several ML methods, from nearest neighbors via logistic regression to neural networks and Bayesian analysis (not covered much in our course). Here follows a set up on how to analyze these data.

# Part a)
The first part deals with structuring and reading the data, much along the same lines as done in projects 1 and 2.
# Part b)
Perform a logistic regression analysis and see if you can reproduce the results of figure 3 of the above article.
# Part c)
The next step is to use neural networks and the functionality provided by tensorflow/keras or scikit-learn's MLP method (or you could write your own code). Compare and discuss again your results with those from the above article.

# Part d)
The above article does not study random forests or support vector machine algorithms. Try to apply one of these methods or both to the credit card data and see if these methods provide a better description of the data. Can you outperform the authors of the article?

# Part e)
Finally, here you should present a critical assessment of the methods you have studied and link your results with the existing literature.
