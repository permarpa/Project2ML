# Abstract

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with nearly 1.7 million new cases diagnosed in 2012, representing about 25 per cent of all cancers in women. Incidence rates vary widely across the world, from 27 per 100,000 in Middle Africa and Eastern Asia to 92 per 100,000 in Northern America. It is the fifth most common cause of death from cancer in women, with an estimated 522,000 deaths (6.4 per cent of the total). It is also the most frequent cause of cancer death in women from regions characterised by lower indices of development and/or income (14.3 per cent of deaths), and the second most frequent from regions characterised by higher indices of development and/or income (15.4 per cent of deaths), after lung cancer.

Specifically, linear-programming-based machine learning techniques are used to increase the accuracy and objectivity of breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

The machine learning field, which can be briefly defined as enabling computers make successful predictions using past experiences, has exhibited an impressive development recently with the help of the rapid increase in the storage capacity and processing power of computers.

In this work we used the dataset of 569 patients, and different combinations of features were tested
to find those which best separate benign from malignant samples. Five-fold cross-validation
accuracy of 97$\%$ was achieved using a single separating plane on four of the thirty features: mean texture, mean perimeter, mean compactness and mean symmetry.
